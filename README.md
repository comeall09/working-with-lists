# Common tasks on working with lists in React

## Infinite scrolling:

### 1. Updating data remotely involves sending a request for data every time the scroll reaches the end of a block

### located on the branch [infinite-scrolling-remotely](https://github.com/comeall09/infinite-scroll/tree/infinite-scrolling-remotely).

### 2. Updating data locally involves fetching all of the data at once, but only displaying a portion of it. The list grows without making additional requests

### located on the branch [infinite-scrolling-locally](https://github.com/comeall09/infinite-scroll/tree/infinite-scrolling-locally).

## Filtering:

### 1. Remote array filtering. When a string is entered into an input, a server request is made after a short delay.

### located on the branch [filtering-remotely](https://github.com/comeall09/working-with-lists/tree/filtering-remotely).

### 2. Local array filtering. A server request is made only once, and further filtering happens on the client side.

### located on the branch [filtering-locally](https://github.com/comeall09/working-with-lists/tree/filtering-locally).

#### Each method has two options:

#### - A request to match any property of an object.

#### - A request to match a specified property of an object
